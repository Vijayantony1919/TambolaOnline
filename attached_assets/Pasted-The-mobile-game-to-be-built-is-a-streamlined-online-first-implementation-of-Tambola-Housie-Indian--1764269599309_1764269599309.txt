The mobile game to be built is a streamlined, online-first implementation of Tambola (Housie/Indian Bingo/Bingo 90) designed for fast onboarding, low cognitive load, and clean, high-contrast gameplay. The game uses the standard 1–90 number pool where each number is drawn exactly once, displayed on a caller board showing uncalled, called, and current numbers. Each player receives 1–3 automatically generated 3×9 Tambola tickets, each containing 15 numbers distributed correctly by column ranges (1–9, 10–19, …, 80–90). During gameplay, users tap ticket cells to mark or unmark numbers as they are called. The MVP supports six core winning patterns: Early 5, Top Row, Middle Row, Bottom Row, Corners, and Full House. Claims are validated in real time: a player taps “Claim,” selects a prize if multiple are active, and the system verifies whether the ticket satisfies the pattern based on numbers drawn so far. Invalid claims return a visible error; valid claims broadcast the winner and close the prize.

The app mirrors the UX of top Tambola mobile titles but in a cleaner, less casino-like style: bright but minimal colors, large typography for current numbers, small chips for recent numbers, a separate 1–90 board overlay, and clear marked/unmarked ticket states. The main menu presents a single primary action, “Play Online,” which triggers quick matchmaking: the system instantly creates or joins a game, fills empty seats with bots, shows a loading state, displays fellow players, and launches a 5-second countdown before the first number. The in-game screen prioritizes focus: a large current number at the top, a strip of recent numbers, swipeable or stacked user tickets in the center, and a bottom claim panel listing all prizes with statuses. A settings icon allows toggling sound and exiting the game. The loop draws a new number every configurable interval (default 3 seconds), animating each number’s arrival and optionally using voice calling in future versions. Number drawing pauses during claim validation and resumes automatically. When all configured Full House prizes are claimed, the game ends and transitions to a results screen summarizing player performance, winners for each prize, and offering “Play again.”

The core data models are Player, Ticket, Cell, Game, and Prize. A simple state machine includes Lobby (player joins, tickets generated), Countdown, Running (draw numbers), Claim Pending (pause to validate), and Ended (show results). The initial build can use pseudo-multiplayer with bots and full client-side state but should be architected so a WebSocket-based real multiplayer service (joinGame, gameStateUpdate, claimPrize, markCell) can replace the local mock seamlessly. The implementation should use a React or TypeScript structure in which a GameProvider manages state and screens such as MainMenu, Game, and Results. MVP scope excludes currency, meta-progression, private rooms, avatars, chat, and multilingual audio, but the architecture should allow incremental addition of these features in later versions, such as private-hosted rooms, advanced prize patterns, XP systems, visual polish, and event scheduling. This prompt should guide the AI agent to construct a mobile Tambola game that launches instantly, plays smoothly, avoids user confusion, and provides a complete end-to-end round using clean design, robust state management, and scalable game logic.
